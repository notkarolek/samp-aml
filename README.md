Attention:
Available Types:
- GTA Sa 2.10 arm64-v8a
- GTA Sa 2.00 armeabi-v7a
There is no 2.10 armeabi-v7a version!!

If it's a arizona client, make sure it's a chen4x version (arz 2.2), if you wanna use mods like sautils
unless you know how to patch it to be supported

the ModLoaderCore.ini is important as it features a setting that let's more mods work

AndroidModLoader is creation and property of RUSJJ aka [-=KILL MAN=-]

I did not create any part of AndroidModLoader, I only uploaded this with the right config and additions
